# MLB_Capstone2025
Repo for Senior Capstone project 

The purpose of this study is to determine if the 2023 rule changes the MLB made to the game had an effect on the attendance of the games. This project examines baseball data from the 2014 season to the 2024 season to see if there was a meaningful effect. Using Python weâ€™re able to determine trends, predict the future of attendance, and finding relationships between game time and attendance. The results from this study should give us a better understanding of how the rule change affected the overall game and what the future of baseball could look like.
